## About

This Python3 development project establishes an environment for data processing and file manipulation. It structures a PyCharm project, imports a massive dataset, and accomplishes three main tasks. It creates language-specific files and a comprehensive translation dataset ensurimg clean file management with GitHub integration.

## Python Files

- `functions.py`: Contains functions to answer the queations for generating files from Excel to Jsonl.
- `main.py`: The main program file that loads, processes, and analyzes student data.

## Data Produced

- `Excel_Files`: The output excel files thats contains id's of all langauges.
- `JSONL_Files`: The jsonl files that contain the pretty printed jsonl formatted for each language.
- `JSONL_Output`: Contains DE, SW and EN jsonl files.
- `translations.json`: Large json file showing all the translations from en to xx with id and utt for all the train sets.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Modify the `file_path` variable in `main.py` to point to your Excel file.
3. Run `main.py` to process the data and generate email addresses, separate students, and more.
4. Review the generated files for results.

## Dependencies

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- openpyxl: Library for reading and writing Excel files.
- re: Regular expression module for text processing.
