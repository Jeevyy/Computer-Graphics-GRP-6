## About

This Python project demonstrates how to process student data from an Excel file. It includes functions for generating email addresses, separating students by gender, identifying special characters in names, merging data into one file, and shuffling the data.

## Files

- `functions.py`: Contains functions for generating email addresses and checking special characters.
- `constraints.py`: Placeholder for constraints or configurations (if needed).
- `main.py`: The main program file that loads, processes, and analyzes student data.

## Data

- `testfile.xlsx`: The input Excel file containing student data.
- `merged_students.xlsx`: The merged Excel file with all student data.
- `shuffled_students.json`: JSON file containing shuffled student data.
- `output_emailF.xlsx`: Excel file with generated email addresses.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Modify the `file_path` variable in `main.py` to point to your Excel file.
3. Run `main.py` to process the data and generate email addresses, separate students, and more.
4. Review the generated files for results.

## Dependencies

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- openpyxl: Library for reading and writing Excel files.
- re: Regular expression module for text processing.
